# ABOUT ME

Lorena Mihelač was born on January 13, 1963 in Tuzla, Bosna and Hercegovina. She finished her primary school in Rotterdam, started her secondary education in Rotterdam at Sint Montfort College (program natural sciences), and finished the secondary education (Gymnasium for languages), and at the same time music secondary school in Zagreb 1981. In 1980, being still a student of secondary school, she started with the Academy of music in Zagreb and graduated in 1984. In 1986 she started with her post degree master study in Novi Sad, Serbia, at the Academy of arts and finished it in 1988. In 2012, she obtained her PhD in Intercultural Studies (program Slovene studies), at ZRC SAZU, Ljubljana, Slovenia. In the same year, 2012, she started a new study at Faculty of information studies in Novo mesto, Slovenia and obtained her diploma thesis in 2015. She continued at the same institution in 2015 with post degree study and obtained in 2017 master thesis.  In 2017, she decided to continue with a new doctoral study at the International Postgraduate School at the Jožef Stefan Institute, Slovenia (program “Information and Communication Technologies”) under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Geraint A. Wiggins, and co-supervision of Prof. Dr. Janez Povh.

In 1985 she was accepted to the position of a junior researcher under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Smiljka Horga at the Department of Kinesiology Intonation – applied music in sport and Information technology in sport, Zagreb, Croatia, and worked in this area till 1991, when she moved back to Slovenia due to the war conditions.

Her research work covers different areas: sport and music, education science, music psychology. From 2015 on, the emphasis is on music perception, especially on the modelling of human perception of music in children, furthermore on computational searching for (ir)regularities and (dis)similarities in musical structure.

She is almost 22 years a coordinator of several international projects (lately, projects under the umbrella of Erasmus+), mainly about mechatronics, robotics, and electronics.

She is a collaborator and supervisor in SciDrom – IoT, ŠC Novo mesto, a scientific lab, within the School center ŠC Novo mesto, covering the area “measurement of loudness” (in preparation for the Dolenjska region), and  researching the impact of music on human health (music therapy).
