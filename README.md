## Computational segmentation

Musicological and psychological studies have contributed to the development of computational science models for automated melodic grouping. Many of them have been compared to participant segmentation, but only on adults, not on children of varying ages. As a result, a computational approach have been employed to understand segmentation in children of varying ages.
