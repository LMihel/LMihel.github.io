## Segmentation in children

In music structural analysis, a musical work is decomposed (segmented) into its constituent elements. Segmentation is mostly used in a purely musical-theoretical sense to determine how a piece of music is constructed, how structural units interact, and how they are connected. Due to the ambiguity of music, determining segment boundaries may be challenging. Even though two persons have similar experience of a musical work, their perceptions of the musical piece or its structural parts may be quite different.

The majority of research on the mechanisms underlying perceptual grouping in music is conducted on adults. Only a few studies have examined how very young toddlers and children of particular age perceive and organize musical structure. Furthermore, most of research on children is either focused on a certain age group or on specific musical dimensions and features, with little attention paid to music segmentation.

There is currently no research on how children of various ages perceive boundaries in music or how music is segmented. The aim of a recent research was to bridge the gap in this population's comprehension of music segmentation and to present a more complete picture of human segmentation.

## Computational segmentation

Musicological and psychological studies have contributed to the development of computational science models for automated melodic grouping. Many of them have been compared to participant segmentation, but only on adults, not on children of varying ages. As a result, a computational approach have been employed to understand segmentation in children of varying ages.

## (Ir)regularity in children's folk songs

In music, regularity is perceived as a highly ordered texture with prominent periodic patterns and strong neighboring relationships, in which musical ideas are organized in a way that the human mind can understand. In contrast, irregularity is experienced in an unstructured or poorly structured musical piece, where the relationship between patterns is rarely discernible and enjoyment is diminished by the enormous mental space required to process unique musical content. The interaction between regularity and irregularity in musical structure is one of the fundamental forms of musical expression used by composers across all musical styles (perhaps with different proportions in different aesthetics). 

Even though interest in children's folk songs has increased among ethnomusicologists, sociologists, educators, and folklorists since 1940, there is a lack of study on children's folk songs. The majority of research on children's folk songs is related to musical content, the social and cultural significance of children's folk songs and their relationships to adult music, the contribution of children's folk songs to cultural preservation, and the transmission of children's folk songs from generation to generation. Generally, the musical structure of children's folk songs is analyzed in terms of musical elements/dimensions, i.e., how the elements/dimensions are used (e.g., pitch span, use of meter, keys, rhythm, contour etc.).

The impact of various musical elements/dimensions on children's folk song perceptions of (ir)regularity and complexity is mostly unclear. Although cross-cultural study on melodic complexity has been undertaken, the majority of it has focused on children's lullabies. There are currently no studies that use computational models to simulate the perception of (ir)regularity in children's folk songs. This may be because children's folk songs are generally considered to be regular, with a simple structure with repeated patterns, and even as a primitive layer of folk songs.

## (Ir)regularity in different musical genres

### Examining (ir)regularity using harmony and experimental approach

In the article by Mihelač & Povh (2020), we contribute to the longstanding challenge of how to explain the listener’s acceptability for a particular piece of music, using harmony as one of the crucial dimensions in music, one of the least examined in this context. We propose three measures for the complexity of harmony: (i) the complexity based on usage of the basic tonal functions and parallels in the harmonic progression, (ii) the entropies of unigrams and bigrams in the sequence of chords, and (iii) the regularity of the harmonic progression. Additionally, we propose four measures for the acceptability of musical pieces (perceptual variables): difficulty, pleasantness, recognition, and repeatability.

These measures have been evaluated in each musical example within our dataset, consisting of 160 carefully selected musical excerpts from different musical styles. The first and the third complexity measures and the musical style of excerpts were determined by the first author using criteria described in the article, while the entropies were computed by computer using Shannon’s formula, after the harmonic progression was determined. The four perceptual variables were obtained by a group of 21 participants, taking their mean values as the final score.

A statistical analysis of this dataset shows that all the measures of complexity are consistent and are together with the musical style important features in explaining the musical acceptability. These relations were further elaborated by regression tree analysis for difficulty and pleasantness after unigram entropy was eliminated due to high correlation with bigram entropy. Results offer reasonable interpretations and also illuminate the relative importance of the predictor variables. In particular, the regularity of the harmonic progression is in both cases the most important predictor.

## (Dis)similarities in the use of musical elements between and within 22 European countries

Music is believed to be "universal." Hence, if music is universal, what distinguishes one culture's music from another, and why is music perceived as dissimilar when two or more cultures are compared, despite the fact that musical components such as tempo, pitch, and rhythm are used consistently across cultures?

Numerous plausible explanations have been proposed, with biological and cultural explanations dominating in recent decades. Traditionally, cross-cultural research aimed at identifying (dis)similarities (either manually or computationally) has concentrated on biological or cultural aspects. However, because music is neither a cultural nor a biological product, linking biological (individual neurobiological variability and its impact, up to the population level) and cultural differences in understanding of musical diversity could help better explain musical diversity. 

There are currently no studies examining the (dis)similarities between and within countries in terms of how musical dimensions and features are understood and used in genres thought to reflect culture (folk songs, children's folk songs, and children's songs). Therefore, a recent research has investigated the cross-cultural (dis)similarities in musical dimensions and features across three genres, folk songs, children's folk songs, and children's songs, in 22 European countries considered to be geographically close or with similar political/historical/economic/cultural backgrounds.
